It wasn't really clear if I should change the README, but I assume it would be nice just in case someone tries to run this without context.

How to use the interface
=================================================
It works basically like a bash like interface with "Command argument1 argument2" style commands.

To checkout a book type "Checkout book nameOfTheBook".
To checkout a movie type "Checkout movie nameOfTheMovie".
To return a book type "Return book nameOfTheBook".
To return a movie type "Return movie nameOfTheMovie".

To login type "Login LibraryNumber Password".

As a librarian, you can view who is renting a book, type "View Renter nomeOfTheBook".

Everything else is either a single command without arguments or follows a similar pattern.
